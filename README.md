# ds-precourse-scatterplots

---

This repository holds the challenges for the scatter plot lesson for DSI precourse. You can find the assignment in the `notebooks` directory. 

There are three plots for you to complete in the notebook and export to image files for grading. The instructions to do so are included in the assignment.

Don't forget that you can always find help in the [DS precourse slack community](https://dsi-precourse-g.slack.com) on the #ask_for_technical_help channel.
